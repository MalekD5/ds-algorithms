# Devide and conqure 

devide and conqure is an approach used to solve a large problem by:
 1. breaking the problem into a smaller sub problems.
 2. solving the sub problems.
 3. combining them to get the solution.

this approach uses [**recursion**](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-recursion-works-explained-with-flowcharts-and-a-video-de61f40cb7f9) to break the problem into smaller sub problems. so it is important to understand recursion in order to understand how this algorithm works.
